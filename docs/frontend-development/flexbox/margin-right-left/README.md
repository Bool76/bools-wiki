# Flexbox | Margin-Right + Margin-Left

Summary - How to use utilize margin-right and margin-left in relation to aligning items to the left or right

#### Scenario
I was working in a mobile header where I wanted to keep the hamburger menu aligned to the left and shift the account and cart icon to the right. The parent div was set as a FLEX display type, so I couldn't use the old school CSS "align: right". So how could I do it?
