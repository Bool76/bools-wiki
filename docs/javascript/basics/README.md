# Javascript | Basics

Overview - Breaking down some basic important concepts to remember about Javascript

### Curly Brackets - { }

#### With a Variable
When you see these know that you're seeing an object

#### With a Function 
Everything within the curly brackets w/ a function is part of the function and will fire off

<br><br>

### Square Brackets - [ ]

#### With a Variable 
When you see these know that you're seeing an array or a list

<br><br>

### .Value
Quite often you'll see a `.value` notation regarding a variable.  

```
bikes.value = results
```

<br><br>

### "Return" and it's relationship w/ Function
More times than not you'll need a `return` declaration at the end of a function so that you're returning some sort of value. Otherwise it's quite possible that a function does a bunch of stuff but then doesn't give you anything and that's what you're missing.

### Keys
An object will have properties define what it is. 

*Example* 
If you had an object called "Car" then some of it's properties could be: 
- Transmission
- Engine 
- Doors
- Color

An object's properties can also be called **Keys**
