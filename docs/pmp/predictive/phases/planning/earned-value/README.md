# Planning | Earned Value

Overview - The **Earned Value** concept is centered around data-driven insights into the project progress and projections as measured against the original plans of timeline and costs

### Cost Key Concepts

**Budget After Completion (BAC)** - The total budget that has been estimated for all the work. AKA - Project Budget (dollars)

**Actual Cost (AC)** - Cost incurred for work performed (dollars)

**Cost Variance (CV)** - Project status in terms of cost - ADD MORE TO THIS? (calculation)

**Variance at Completion (VAC)** - A projection of the budget surplus or deficit (calcaulation)

**Cost Performance Index (CPI)** - A measure of cost efficiency of budgeted resources (calculation)

**Estimate AT Completion (EAC)** - MAKE SURE THIS IS RIGHT! Tool to reassess total costs needed to complete the project as it stands (calculation) Or expected cost to complete all the work - During the project

**Estimate TO Completion (ETC)** - Predicts the money a project still needs. ETC is the forecast of all additional money required to complete a project. It does not account for money already spent. (calculation)

### Work / Value Key Concepts

**Planning Value (PV)** - Work that should have been completed (planned work) by a specific point in the schedule (percentage)

**Earning Value (EV)** - The amount of work that has actually been completed so far (percentage)

**Schedule Variance (SV)** - Project status in terms of schedule (calculation)

**Schedule Performance Index (SPI)** - A measure of schedule efficiency. Earned value to planned value. Remember: Value = Work (calculation)

**To Complete Performance Index (TCPI)** - Measure of cost performance (work performance?) that must be achieved w/ the remaining resources in order to meet goals (calculation)
