# Planning | Earned Value

Overview - The **Earned Value** concept is centered around data-driven insights into the project progress and projections as measured against the original plans of timeline and costs

### Cost Key Terms

**Planning Value (PV)** - Actual work plan to be completed. Authorized costs. Work planned (dollars or percentage??? Might have to move this)

**Actual Cost (AC)** - Cost incurred for work performed (dollars)

**Budget After Completion (BAC)** - I think this is just like the Project Budget (dollars)

**Cost Variance (CV)** - Project status in terms of cost - ADD MORE TO THIS? (calculation)

**Variance at Completion (VAC)** - A projection of the budget surplus or deficit (calcaulation)

**Cost Performance Index (CPI)** - A measure of cost efficiency of budgeted resources (calculation)

<br><br>

### Work / Value Key Terms

**Earning Value (EV)** - Measure of work completed so far (percentage)

**Schedule Variance (SV)** - Project status in terms of schedule (calculation)

**Schedule Performance Index (SPI)** - A measure of schedule efficiency. Earned value to planned value. Remember: Value = Work (calculation)

### Calculations

#### Cost Calculations

| Name                         | Calculation     | Result Definitions                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cost Variance (CV)           | EV - AC         | Under Budget<br>On Budget                                                       |
| Variance at Completion (VAC) | BAC - EAC (???) | Under Budget -> Postive<br>On Budget -> Equals Zero<br>Under Budget -> Negative |
| Cost Performance Index (CPI) | EV / AC         | Under Budget -> Greater 1<br>On Budget -> Equal 1<br>Under Budget -> Less 1     |

#### Work / Value Calculations

| Name                             | Calculation | Result Definitions                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Schedule Variance (SV)           | EV - PV     | Ahead Schedule -> Positive<br>On Schedule -> Equals Zero<br>Behind Schedule -> Negative |
| Schedule Performance Index (SPI) | EV / PV     | Ahead Schedule -> Greater 1<br>On Schedule -> Equal 1<br>Behind Schedule -> Less 1      |
